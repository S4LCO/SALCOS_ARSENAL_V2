## Mod Info {.tabset}

### OVERVIEW
Phew!   
My eyes are burning, my brain is fried, and my fingers are sore.  
But here it is: the significantly improved and more stable version of my baby – SALCO'S ARSENAL.

While I wrote the basic framework of the first version almost entirely on my own, with just a little help from friends and family, this time I used a little bit of AI, which saved me a ton of time.  

Before you start downloading and installing this mod, I recommend that you read everything here very carefully.  
<br>  
<br>  

**💰 SUPPORT**  
In Germany we say:  
"Support ist kein Mord" which means [feel free to support my ice-tea addiction on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/salco1)  
<br>  
<br>  

Much love! 🖤


### ABOUT THE MOD
**WHAT DOES THIS MOD (NOT) DO? 🤔**  
This mod creates customized variants of existing items by cloning vanilla and [WTT -  Content Backport](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/mod/2512/wtt-content-backport) items and modifying them via JSON.  

Weapons, ammo, attachments, armor, and items are adjusted through stat changes, compatibility tweaks, and configuration overrides.   

It also adds hideout crafting recipes, extends weapon magazine/ammo compatibility, and injects additional stim buffs into the global game configuration.  

This mod does **NOT** add new 3D models.  
<br>  
<br>  

**WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 'SALCO'S ARSENAL MOD'? 🤨**  
Throw that crap in the bin.   
Seriously.   
Do it!  
Forget that the old version ever existed.   
Please.

### CONTENT
**SOME INFO ABOUT THE CONTENT**  
All the content provided by this mod is generally not as overpowered as in the first version.  
Where there are advantages, there are also disadvantages.  
Many of the items are only marginally better than what is currently meta.  
Ammo is in top 3 of their caliber class.  
Almost anything can be bought at the flea market, can be uses by bots or is foundable in raid.
